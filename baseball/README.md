# SportSimulation

### Current Stage

Currently about to work on building game funcitonality and 
hooking games up with go routines to be super fast at simulating thousands
of games.

### Next Steps

Build another package to scrape baseball savant if the input includes
modern teams only. I expect the scraping part to be simple in goquery but will
likley have to expand the bsbl package a lot to support a game in which every 
pitch is simulated unlike the baseball reference games will be.
